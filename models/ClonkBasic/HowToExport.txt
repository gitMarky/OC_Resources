1. Adjust UVs as desired
2. Rename material "enter_material_name" to your desired material name
3. Join meshes under "armature" as desired
4. Delete the unnecessary meshes
5. Rename the mesh datablock to "include.Clonk" => this is necessary so that it will use the skeleton "include.Clonk.skeleton" after the export
6. When using the exported mesh in one of your objects, use the "include.Clonk.skeleton" from this directory, because the exported skeleton may be broken
